# Introduction
Welcome to DGen Token! This document provides an overview of the DGen Token contract and its mint, burn, and transfer functions. DGen Token is an ERC-20 compatible token built on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to perform basic token operations like minting, burning, and transferring.

# Smart Contract Details
Token Standard
DGen Token follows the ERC-20 standard, which is a widely adopted standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

# Challenge
Your task is to create a ERC20 token and deploy it on the Avalanche network for Degen Gaming. The smart contract should have the following functionality:

Minting new tokens: The platform should be able to create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards. Only the owner can mint tokens.
Transferring tokens: Players should be able to transfer their tokens to others.
Redeeming tokens: Players should be able to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.
Checking token balance: Players should be able to check their token balance at any time.
Burning tokens: Anyone should be able to burn tokens, that they own, that are no longer needed.


Mint Function
The mint function is responsible for creating new tokens and increasing the total supply of DGen Tokens. Only specific accounts or roles with the necessary permissions are allowed to call the mint function. Minting can be performed in various situations like token sale events, rewards, or any other use case where new tokens need to be generated.

Burn Function
The burn function allows token holders to permanently remove their tokens from circulation. When tokens are burned, the total supply of DGen Tokens decreases accordingly. This function helps maintain token scarcity or implement deflationary mechanisms.

Transfer Function
The transfer function enables token holders to send their DGen Tokens to other addresses. This function is a core feature of ERC-20 tokens, allowing users to perform peer-to-peer transactions.

Reedem Function
Players should be able to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.

Conclusion
Thank you for your interest in DGen Token! If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers or consult the official documentation. Happy minting, burning, and transferring!
